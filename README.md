![VRDEMO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56ed6e7c-0114-4f2a-b85c-179931414dcd)

Every three seconds the scene will alternate between two ways of rendering the scene:

**1. Helmholtz (Miniature)**: Vergence, vertical disparities, and horizontal disparities set to near viewing. Resulting scene seen as miniature, as noted by Helmholtz (1857): 

<blockquote>“...as if the observer were looking not at the natural landscape itself, but at a very exquisite and exact model of it, reduced in scale.”</blockquote>

**2. Linton (Normal)**: Vergence and vertical disparities set to near viewing, but horizontal disparities set to normal viewing distance. Scene now looks normal size, not miniature.
